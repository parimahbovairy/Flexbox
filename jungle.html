          <summary>Can you hike in the jungle?</summary>
          You can definitely hike in the jungle. In fact, if you’re planning on
          hiking in Central or South America, Southeast Asia, parts of Australia
          or Hawaii, there’s a decent chance that’s exactly what you’ll be
          doing. But hiking in the jungle will definitely mean different
          conditions (and wildlife) from what you’re probably used to, and
          therefore it does require some special preparation, particularly in
          terms of how to dress.

            →The idea of hiking usually conjures up images of frozen alpine
            tundra on exposed, rocky summits, but many of the world’s best hikes
            and treks actually take place in dense, tangled undergrowth of the
            jungle. Exotic locations like the Amazon rainforest, Costa Rica’s
            Monteverde Cloud Forest and Thailand’s Khao Sok National Park might
            spark the sense of adventure in you, but you may also be wondering
            what you need to know before you go. After all, if the stakes aren’t
            higher when it comes to hiking in the jungle, they’re certainly
            going to be different from alpine hiking. What do you wear? Will
            there be snakes? In this article, we cover what to expect from
            hiking in the jungle, and how to prepare for heat, humidity, tangled
            forests and biting bugs.

          <span>Monteverde Cloud Forest</span>, Costa Rica Costa Rica’s
          Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve is one of the country’s most
          fascinating destinations. This area is home to more than one hundred
          mammal species, four hundred species of bird, thousands of different
          insects, and thousands of different plants. If you are lucky you may
          well spot howler monkeys, jaguars, ocelots, tapirs, and macaws and one
          of its most magical residents is the beautiful, brightly coloured
          quetzal that was considered divine by Pre-Columbian Mesoamerican
          civilisations. Cloud forests take their name from their very literal
          nature. Often taking the form of fog, low-hanging clouds hover around
          the upper canopy of the forest before condensing onto the leaves of
          trees and dripping onto the plants below. The feeling here is as if
          the sky has come down into the forest, meaning that you’ll be walking
          through the clouds. Because of the clouds the sun doesn’t often break
          through which causes a slower rate of evaporation and provides the
          plants with an abundance of life-giving moisture which promote a huge
          amount of biodiversity, particularly within the type of plants known
          as epiphytes.

          <span> Sok National Park</span>, Thailand In a stark contrast to the
          famous beaches of Thailand, Khao Sok National Park is Thailand’s
          rainiest spot and, at 160 million years old it is thought to be the
          oldest rainforest on Earth. Visit Khao Sok National Park to hike,
          kayak, take Jeep safaris, and even ride elephants. Many people head
          here to try and spot the Rafflesia kerrii, one of the worlds biggest
          (and smelliest) flowers. The largest example recorded reached 112 cm
          in width. The walks around here are a beautiful mix of green terrain,
          woodland and waterfalls, do watch out for the leeches though which can
          be a real pain, especially after rainfall.

          Rainforest, Queensland, Australia The Daintree Rainforests diverse
          landscape includes gorges, waterfalls, mountains, dense forest, white
          sand beaches, and fringing reefs just offshore. This is an incredibly
          beautiful spot that has something to offer every single taste.
          Contained within the rare combination of landscape are 3% of the frog,
          reptile and marsupial species in Australia, 90% of Australia’s bat and
          butterfly species, and 7% of Australia’s bird species. If you are a
          wildlife lover you simply must visit this part of Australia, because
          all of this diversity is contained in an area that makes up less than
          1% of the country’s total landmass. Daintree National Park is a two
          hour drive north of Cairns, or about an hour north of Port Douglas.
          Day tours by 4WD or coach depart from Cairns and Port Douglas all year
          round, or if you fancy going it alone you can always hire a car. For
          longer visits there are some lovely towns and villages on the
          rainforest’s doorstep, such as Mossman or Cape Tribulation if you
          fancy hanging around for a while.

          <span>Volcanoes National Park</span>, Rwanda Volcanoes National Park
          is home to five of the eight major volcanoes of the Virunga Mountains
          and is also home to the critically endangered and magnificent mountain
          gorilla. Walking in Rwanda is on a huge amount of peoples bucket lists
          because seeing the beautiful mountain gorilla in its natural habitat
          is truly an awe-inspiring, once -in-a-lifetime experience. Though
          encounters can never be guaranteed, the area has some of the best and
          most experienced trackers in the world. There are also a variety of
          other primates to spot, including the golden monkey, elephants,
          buffalo, and hyenas. You will pay for this experience though, in a
          very sensible bid to regulate the activity, the governments of Congo,
          Rwanda and Uganda decided to make permits to go gorilla treking. These
          are more expensive than any other wildlife permit in the world and aim
          to limit the number of visitors and create sustainability of the
          activity. The gorilla permit costs $400 in Congo (DRC), $1500 in
          Rwanda and $600 in Uganda. These gorilla permits help to limit stress
          on the apes and on their habitat which could result in change of
          behaviour and even death. There is only a maximum of 8 permits per
          gorilla group sold each day to make sure the gorillas are not
          overwhelmed by the human presence.
